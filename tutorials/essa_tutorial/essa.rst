Calculations and Analysis
===============================================================================

First, we will make necessary imports from ProDy_, NumPy_, Matplotlib_, and Pandas_
packages if you haven't already done it:

.. ipython:: python

   from prody import *
   from numpy import *
   from matplotlib.pyplot import *
   from pandas import *
   ion()

Generation of ESSA profile 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, we parse a structure on which we want to perform ESSA. 
For this tutorial, we will fetch the TEM-1 beta-lactamase (1pzo) from the PDB.

.. ipython:: python

   ag = parsePDB('1pzo', compressed=False)

ESSA is implemented as a ProDy class, so we can instantiate an :class:`.ESSA` 
object.

.. ipython:: python

   essa = ESSA()

Before starting residue scanning, we first need to set the system. Even though 
the ligand(s) are not included in the scanning, they can be specified for further 
analysis. For this purpose, users can simply give the chain ids and residue numbers 
as a string shown in the following. The protein residues interacting with each ligand 
can be determined within a specific cutoff distance (default ``dist=4.5``). 
ESSA will use the title of the atomic object provided to it in the names of the 
output files.

ESSA, by default, generates a :class:`.ModeEnsemble` containing the modes 
resulting from the perturbation of each residue. However, if the user does not 
have enough memory resources for conducting computation on a large structure, 
then ``lowmem=True`` should be chosen, thus only storing eigenvalues/eigenvectors 
for each perturbed model. 

In the structure 1pzo, there are two identical allosteric inhibitors (residues 300 and 301 of chain A).
ESSA can be informed about them when setting the system as follows:

.. ipython:: python

   essa.setSystem(ag, lig='A 300 A 301')

Scanning can be done using :func:`.scanResidues`. Here one can specify the number 
of softest modes, the type of ENM (GNM or ANM), and the cutoff, which by default 
are ``n_modes=10``, ``enm='gnm'``, ``cutoff=None``, respectively. If ``cutoff`` 
is not specified, its value is adopted from the default value of the specified ENM. 
During the scanning, the progress will also be displayed.

.. ipython:: python

   essa.scanResidues()

The generated ESSA profile can be shown by :func:`.showESSAProfile`. On this profile, 
the residues interacting with the previously specified ligand(s) are automatically 
highlighted. The blue dashed baseline shows the q-th quantile of the profile, which is by 
default ``q=0.75``, representing the top quartile. Other residues of interest 
can also be indicated with their single-letter code and residue number on this plot 
if specified by a ProDy selection string provided as a parameter. Users can dynamically 
customize the properties of the plot using the matplotlib context manager as shown below.

.. ipython:: python

   @savefig essa_profile.png width=8in
   with style.context({'figure.dpi': 100}):
       essa.showESSAProfile()

ESSA z-scores can be obtained as a NumPy array using :func:`.getESSAZscores`, and saved with 
:func:`.saveESSAZscores`. Let's have the z-scores of the first ten residues:

.. ipython:: python

   essa.getESSAZscores()[:10]

.. ipython:: python

   essa.saveESSAZscores()

In order to visualize the essential residues, a PDB file can be generated, in 
which the z-scores are written in the B-factor column. Later, this file can be 
opened in a molecular graphics program such as PyMOL or VMD, where the structure 
can be colored according to the B-factors. 

.. ipython:: python

   essa.writeESSAZscoresToPDB()

Please check the other getter and save methods and their docstrings, such as those 
for ligand binding residues.

Prediction of allosteric pockets
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Allosteric pocket prediction requires Fpocket 3.0 and Pandas installed in your 
system. The first step is the pocket hunting, which is automatically carried out 
in the background, by calling :func:`.scanPockets`. This method parses the pocket 
features provided by Fpocket, and all identified pockets are stored in a folder 
ending with **_out** in the current working directory. Additionally, maximum/median 
ESSA scores are assigned to each pocket based on the ESSA scores of the residues 
forming it.

.. ipython:: python

   essa.scanPockets()

Pocket features that are stored in a Pandas DataFrame can be obtained by 
:func:`.getPocketFeatures`, and saved as a Python pickle file by 
:func:`.savePocketZscores`.

Key features of the pockets to be used in the prediction, namely ESSA and local 
hydrophobic density (LHD) z-scores, can be listed by :func:`.getPocketZscores`.

.. ipython:: python

   essa.getPocketZscores()

The prediction protocol ranks the pockets with respect to their ESSA and LHD 
z-scores. Concurrently, the pockets with negative LHD z-scores are filtered 
out as allosteric sites are known to have relatively higher LHD. For 
the details of this protocol, please refer to the original ESSA article [KB20]_.

Ranking of the pockets can be performed and obtained by :func:`.rankPockets` and 
:func:`.getPocketRanks`, respectively.

.. ipython:: python

   essa.rankPockets()
   essa.getPocketRanks()

Pocket 6 with the top ESSA_max score has been identified as the only allosteric 
pocket in this structure. Interestingly, other pockets have been filtered 
out due to their negative LHD z-scores. Pocket 6 is a large pocket that includes CBT 
allosteric ligands at A300 and A301, as well as a part of the orthosteric ligand 
(see Figure S2 and Table S2 of [KB20]_).

In order to visualize the pockets, the `.pqr` file, an output of Fpocket needs 
to be opened by PyMOL or VMD together with the original pdb file. 

Pocket z-scores and ranks can be saved by :func:`.savePocketZscores` and 
:func:`.writePocketRanksToCSV`, respectively.

.. ipython:: python

   essa.savePocketZscores()
   essa.writePocketRanksToCSV()

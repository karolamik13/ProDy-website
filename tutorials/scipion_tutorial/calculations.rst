Calculations
===============================================================================

Here are the required imports again. You do not need to repeat them if you are
still in the same python session.

.. ipython:: python

    from prody import *
    from pylab import *
    ion()


Loading the structure and running adaptive ANM
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, we parse the structures that we want to analyse with Adaptive ANM.
For this tutorial, we will use chain A of PDB structures 1GRU and 1GR5, 
which correspond to the R'' and T states, which we will call `r` and `t`.

We load the structures with only calpha atoms, which we use in downstream steps.

.. ipython:: python

    r = parsePDB('1gruA', subset='ca')
    t = parsePDB('1gr5A', subset='ca')

In order to have the same number of atoms in both structures, we use the function 
:func:`.alignChains` to create :class:`.AtomMap` objects with the same number. 

As `r` has more atoms (524) than `t` (517), we provide `t` first to find the common atoms 
that are present in `t`:

.. ipython:: python

    tmap = alignChains(t, r)[0]

This new implementation of Adaptive ANM increases the number of modes calculated 
each cycle depending on which ones were used in the previous cycles and their 
overlaps. We can give it keyword arguments for the maximum number of modes to use
(**3N-6** by default for **N** atoms), starting number of modes (20 by default), and other 
ANM parameters. These parameters can also be presented to the functions below.

Next, we can run AdaptiveANM calculations simply by

.. ipython:: python

    ens = calcAdaptiveANM(r, tmap, 20)
    ens


The implementation in ProDy_ also provides 3 ways of running calculations, namely, 
`AANM_ALTERNATING`, `AANM_ONEWAY`, and `AANM_BOTHWAYS`. `AANM_ALTERNATING` updates 
`r` and `tmap` simultaneously as in the original Adaptive ANM ([ZY09]_) with minor 
variations, whereas `AANM_ONEWAY` and `AANM_BOTHWAYS` carry out the calculations 
from either just one or both directions (starting with A and going until convergence 
then continuing from B). This behavior is controlled by the `mode` 
argument:

.. ipython:: python
   :verbatim:

   ens_1w = calcAdaptiveANM(r, tmap, 20, mode=AANM_ONEWAY)


Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:func:`.calcAdaptiveANM` creates an :class:`Ensemble` object that has all the generated, 
intermediate conformations that bridges `r` and `tmap`. The reference coordinates of `ens` 
are set to those of `tmap`, so that we can verify the result by checking the RMSDs of the 
conformations:

.. ipython:: python

   @savefig aanm_rmsds_alter.png width=4in
   plot(ens.getRMSDs())
   xlabel('R -> T')
   ylabel('RMSD')

We can also perform any other analysis that is applicable to a :class:`Ensemble`: object. 
Other quantities that may be useful for debugging or validation purposes can be obtained 
through assigning a callback function. For example, to extract the number of modes used 
in each iteration, we can write the following function to access and store the value:

.. ipython:: python

   N_MODES = []

   def callback(**kwargs):
      modes = kwargs.pop('modes')
      N_MODES.append(len(modes))

Note that **N_MODES** needs to be defined outside the function, at a global scope, in order 
to save the value for each iteration. **modes** is a :class:`.ModeSet` object that gives you 
the mode(s) selected for deform the structure in an iteration. You have the access to all the 
properties of **modes**, and therefore the whole :class:`.ANM`, but here we are only 
evaluating the number of selected modes using :func:`len`. Please check out the documentation 
of :func:`.calcAdaptiveANM` for a complete list of accessible quantities. 

Now, we pass the callback function to :func:`.calcAdaptiveANM` as follows:

.. ipython:: python

   ens_1w = calcAdaptiveANM(r, tmap, 20, mode=AANM_ONEWAY, callback_func=callback)

And check the number of modes being selected in each iteration:

.. ipython:: python

   print(N_MODES)
